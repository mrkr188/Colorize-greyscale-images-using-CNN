# Colorize greyscale Images using Deep Neural Networks

Designed and Implemented a Deep Convolutional Neural Network system to convert greyscale images into color images without any human intervention. The system makes use of pre trained VGG 16 network with added residual connections between layers. used Tensorflow to build the model and trained it on Amazon g2.x2.large instances with NVIDIA GRID K520 GPUs.
